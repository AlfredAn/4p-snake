# 4-player snake

A multiplayer snake game I made in 2014. Requires NetBeans to build, but a prebuilt jar is available in the dist folder.

The rules in multiplayer mode are as follows:
- If all players are dead, the player with the highest score wins.
- If two or more players are tied for first place, the player that survived the longest wins.

You may have issues with multiplayer if your keyboard does not support [n-key rollover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)#n-key_rollover).
